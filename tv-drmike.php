            <h2>About Dr. Mike Moreno</h2>
            <img src="http://www.drmikediet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/author_pic.jpg" width="50%">
            <p>Dr. Michael Rafael Moreno, better known as “Dr. Mike,” is a graduate of the University of California at Irvine and Hahnemann Medical School (now Drexel University). Following his residency at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana, California, Dr. Mike moved to San Diego, where he now practices family medicine and sits on the board of the San Diego Chapter of the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p>

            <p>In 2008, Dr. Mike launched “Walk with Your Doc,” which he participates in every Tuesday and Thursday morning before his workday begins. The program began when Dr. Mike offered to walk with a patient to motivate her to exercise and has since grown into a thriving community.</p>

            <p>Dr. Mike takes pride in being viewed not only as a doctor, but also as a friend and confidant.</p>

            <p>“We’ve all pledged, promised and bullied ourselves to eat better and exercise more, but so many times even the best intentions fall short,” Dr. Mike says. “I incorporate healthy habits into my work and home life and you can too.”</p>
